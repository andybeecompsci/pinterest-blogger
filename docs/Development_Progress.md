# PinMaker Development Progress

## 📅 February 7, 2024

### 🎯 Project Initialization
#### ✅ Completed
- Set up backend with Express server
- Created clean directory structure for scalability
- Installed backend dependencies:
  - express
  - cors
  - dotenv
  - puppeteer
  - openai
  - nodemon (dev dependency)
- Fixed server.js comment syntax from `#` to `//`
- Verified backend server starts successfully
- Set up frontend structure:
  - Created component directories
  - Implemented placeholder components:
    - TrendsComponent
    - BlogGenerator
    - PinGenerator
  - Set up main layout with Tailwind CSS
  - Configured responsive grid layout

#### 🔧 Issues Encountered & Solutions
1. **Windows Command Line Issues**
   - **Problem**: Directory creation commands using `&&` operator failed
   - **Solution**: Split commands and executed them separately
   - **Learning**: Use Windows-compatible commands or PowerShell syntax for future operations

2. **Server.js Comments**
   - **Problem**: Used `#` for comments causing linter errors
   - **Solution**: Replaced all `#` comments with standard JavaScript `//` comments
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

3. **Frontend Not Initialized**
   - **Problem**: Default Next.js welcome page showing
   - **Solution**: Created custom components and layout
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. ~~Fix server.js comment syntax~~ ✅
2. ~~Initialize Frontend (Next.js)~~ ✅
   - ~~Set up app router structure~~
   - ~~Create initial layout~~
   - ~~Configure Tailwind CSS~~
3. Begin implementing Pinterest trends scraper (Stage 2)
   - Set up Puppeteer configuration
   - Create scraping service
   - Implement trends endpoint
4. Connect frontend to backend
   - Create API client utilities
   - Implement data fetching in components
   - Add loading states and error handling

### 📝 Notes
- Following monorepo approach for easier development and deployment
- Environment variables properly secured in `.env`
- Directory structure set up for scalability following best practices
- Backend server verified working on port 3001
